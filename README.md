# MusicBox-YTMusic
A lightweight Electron app for YouTube Music with QoL fixes.
Available for Windows and Linux!

## Description

I made this very simple Electron app for Youtube Music, as Google still hasn't bothered to make a proper PC app for their own music site.
It's completely open-source and safe. You can be assured that your Google logins are safe.

You can even build the app yourself! (Please build node_modules yourself!)

1.3.0: Changed YT Music's linear volume slider to a logarithmic slider instead. There may be minor audio glitches for a fraction of a second while changing volume.
