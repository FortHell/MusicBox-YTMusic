# MusicBox-YTMusic
A lightweight Electron app for YouTube Music.

Available for Windows (x64) and Linux (deb/AppImage).

I made this very simple Electron app for Youtube Music, as Google still hasn't bothered to make a proper PC app for their own music site.
It's completely open-source, safe and malware-free. You can be assured that your Google logins are safe.

You can even build the app yourself!

If you have any issues or thoughts, don't hesitate to let me know!
